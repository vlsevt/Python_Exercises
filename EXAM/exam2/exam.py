def combine_numbers(numbers: list) -> int:
    """
    Find two elements in the list which give the highest cross sum.

    Cross sum is the sum of all the digits in the number.
    In this exercise you have to apply cross sum calculation until the result is below 10.
    For example: cross sum of 123 => 1 + 2 + 3 => 6
    cross sum on 991 => 9 + 9 + 1 => 19. Because it is not below 10, we calculate 1 + 9 => 10. And again 1 + 0 => 1.

    Here you have to take 2 different elements from the list, put them together
    (writing the first number in front of the second number) and then calculate cross sum.
    And the combined numbers which have the highest cross sum, is the result.

    The order of the combination should be the same as the elements appear in the list.

    combine_numbers([1, 2, 3]) => 23
      we can get the combinations: 12, 13, 23. 23 is the highest
    combine_numbers([1]) => 0
      there are no combinations possible, therefore return 0
    combine_numbers([9, 1]) => 91
      combinations: 91. 9 + 1 => 10, 1 + 0 => 1
    combine_numbers([1, 2, 3, 12, 66]) => 312
      combinations:
      12 => 1 + 2 = 3,
      13 => 1 + 3 = 4,
      112 => 1 + 1 + 2 = 4,
      166 => 1 + 6 + 6 = 13 => 4,
      23 => 5
      212 => 5
      266 => 14 => 5
      312 => 6
      366 => 15 => 6
      1266 => 15 => 6

    the highest cross sum is 6, and we return the first combination (the leftmost) 312.

    Simplification:
    if the function does not calculate second or third round for cross sum, then max points are 60%
    e.g. 991 would give 19
    (in those tests there are no combinations which give cross sum higher than 9)
